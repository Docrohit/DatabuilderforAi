# DatabuilderforAi
Dataset builder code for an Ai that will use planetary positions to predict events in a cricket match. 

I am writing a python code that will use an Api to collect in real time planetary positions of 9 planets in different signs with 
their degrees and in different divisional charts. 

Once this is collected the script should be able to store them in a file with the positions as well as the event that happened in that 
particular placement/alignment.

Later we will use the dataset to train our Ai models.
